=head1 NAME

Business::BR::Biz - Modules for Brazilian business-related subjects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Business::BR::Biz; # does nothing, it is here because of POD and $VERSION

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This modules is a placeholder for the overview of the 'biz-br' 
distribution. It is meant to provide a version number for
'biz-br' distribution and to hold the introductory documentation of the
modules in the distribution.

If you want to see the action, take a look at Business::BR::CPF.

=head2 EXPORT

None by default. 

=head1 TESTING CORRECTNESS

Among the functionalities to be made available in this distribution,
we'll have tests for correctness of typical identification numbers
and codes.

I<To be correct> will mean here to satisfy certain easily computed
rules. For example, a CPF number is correct if it is 11-digits-long
and satisfy two check equations which validate the check digits.

The modules C<Business::BR::*> will provide subroutines C<test_*>
for testing the correctness of such concepts. 

To be I<correct> does not mean that an identification number or code
had been I<verified> to stand for some real entry, like an actual 
Brazilian paytaxer citizen in the case of CPF. This would require
access to government databases which may or may not be available
in a public basis. And besides, to I<verify> something
will not be I<easily computed> in general, implying access to
databases and applying specialized rules.

Here we'll be trying to stick to a consistent terminology
and 'correct' will always be used for validity against syntactical
forms and shallow semantics. In turn, 'verified' will be used 
for telling if an entity really makes sense in the real world. 
This convention is purely arbitrary and for the sake of
being formal in some way. Terms like 'test', 'verify', 'check',
'validate', 'correct', 'valid' are often used interchangeably
in colloquial prose.

=head1 EXAMPLES

As a rule, the documentation and tests choose correct
identification codes which are verified to be invalid by the time
of the distribution update. That is, in Business::BR::CPF,
the mentioned correct CPF number '390.533.447-05' is correct,
but doesn't actually exist in government databases.
